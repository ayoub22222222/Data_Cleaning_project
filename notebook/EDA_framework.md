# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Framework

## **1. Data Overview**
### **Goal:** Understand the structure of your dataset.
- **Check Columns & Data Types**
  - Inspect the data types (categorical, numerical).
  - Identify column groups (e.g., player stats, physical attributes, financial metrics).
- **Missing Values**
  - Count missing values in each column and decide on a strategy to handle them.
- **Descriptive Statistics**
  - Summarize numerical columns (mean, median, min, max, standard deviation).
  - Analyze the distribution of categorical columns (if applicable).

---

## **2. Data Cleaning**
### **Goal:** Ensure the dataset is ready for analysis.
- **Handle Missing Data**
  - Decide how to deal with missing values (e.g., imputation, removal).
- **Fix Column Formats**
  - Convert `Height` and `Weight` to numeric values (if in an unconventional format, like "5'9").
  - Standardize numerical columns like `Value` and `Wage` if they use symbols like "\u20ac".
- **Remove or Transform Irrelevant Columns**
  - Drop duplicate columns or those not useful for analysis (e.g., `Hits` if it's unrelated).
- **Handle Outliers**
  - Use boxplots or statistical methods to detect outliers in columns like `Value`, `Wage`, or `POT`.

---

## **3. Univariate Analysis**
### **Goal:** Explore each column independently.
- **Numerical Columns**
  - Analyze distributions (histograms, KDE plots).
  - Focus on `Age`, `POT`, `Value`, `Wage`, `PAC`, `DEF`, etc.
    - Example: Identify the typical age range or distribution of player values.
- **Categorical Columns**
  - Analyze frequency distributions (bar charts, counts).
  - Identify any imbalance (e.g., distribution of a specific category if applicable).

---

## **4. Bivariate Analysis**
### **Goal:** Explore relationships between two variables.
- **Numerical vs. Numerical**
  - Scatter plots or correlation heatmaps to explore relationships.
  - Key pairs to analyze:
    - `Age` vs. `POT` (Does potential decrease with age?).
    - `Value` vs. `POT` (Do high-potential players have higher value?).
    - `Wage` vs. `Skill` (Does skill directly affect wage?).
- **Numerical vs. Categorical**
  - Boxplots to compare stats across groups (e.g., `PAC` across different value ranges).
    - Example: Analyze how `Value` varies with different levels of `POT`.

---

## **5. Multivariate Analysis**
### **Goal:** Explore relationships between multiple variables simultaneously.
- Use pair plots or correlation heatmaps for key groups:
  - Physical stats (`Height`, `Weight`, `Strength`, `Stamina`).
  - Attacking stats (`Finishing`, `Crossing`, `Dribbling`).
  - Goalkeeping stats (`GK Diving`, `GK Handling`, etc.).
- Identify clusters or patterns using techniques like PCA or t-SNE.

---

## **6. Feature Engineering**
### **Goal:** Create new columns for deeper insights.
- Combine existing stats into composite scores:
  - `Total Skill Stats` = sum of technical stats like `Dribbling`, `Ball Control`, etc.
  - `Physical Index` = weighted combination of `Strength`, `Stamina`, `Pace`.
- Categorize players:
  - Create player roles based on their stats (e.g., Striker, Defender).
  - Bin columns like `Age` into groups (e.g., Young, Prime, Veteran).

---

## **7. Insights & Storytelling**
### **Goal:** Generate actionable insights for a compelling narrative.
- Identify standout patterns:
  - Example: "High-potential players tend to have strong skills in X areas."
- Discuss relationships between columns:
  - Example: "Thereâ€™s a strong correlation between physical stats and market value."
- Present findings visually to communicate key points effectively.

---

## **8. Advanced Analysis**
### **Goal:** Add depth and creativity to the portfolio.
- **Regression Analysis:**
  - Predict `Value` or `Wage` based on other stats (e.g., `POT`, `Total Stats`).
- **Clustering:**
  - Group players into archetypes based on stats (e.g., Physical, Skillful, Balanced).
- **Feature Importance:**
  - Use tree-based models to identify the most important stats for determining `POT` or `Value`.

---

## **9. Visualization Techniques**
### **Goal:** Make the portfolio visually appealing.
- Use a variety of plots:
  - Heatmaps for correlations.
  - Bar and line plots for trends.
  - Scatter plots with color coding for multivariate relationships.
- Add interactivity using Plotly or Altair for standout visuals.

---

## **10. Conclusion**
### **Goal:** Summarize findings and reflect on analysis.
- Present key insights from the data.
- Highlight what you learned about the dataset.
- Suggest practical applications of the analysis (e.g., for player scouting or game design).
